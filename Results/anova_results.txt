ANOVA Results:

Purpose: To determine whether there is a significant difference in the average daily returns of three stocks: Adani Total Gas, Adani Green, and Adani Energy Solutions.

Hypotheses:
- Null Hypothesis (H₀): The average daily returns of the three stocks are equal.
- Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): At least one of the stocks has a significantly different average daily return compared to the others.

Results:
- F-statistic: 0.018070426756260093
- P-value: 0.9820922755100873

Conclusion:
At a significance level of 0.05:
- We fail to reject the null hypothesis (H₀).
- This indicates there is no statistically significant difference in the average daily returns of the three stocks.

Insights from the Violin Plot:
1. The violin plot reveals that while the distributions of daily returns vary slightly in shape and spread for the three stocks:
   - **Adani Green** exhibits a wider spread, suggesting higher volatility in its daily returns.
   - **Adani Total Gas** shows a more compact distribution, indicating relatively stable daily returns.
   - **Adani Energy Solutions** lies in between, with moderate variability.
   
2. Despite these differences in distribution, the mean daily returns are statistically similar, as indicated by the ANOVA results.

Additional Context:
Despite operating in different sectors, these stocks (Adani Green, ATGL, and Adani Ensol) are subsidiaries of the Adani Group conglomerate.
The lack of significant differences in their returns suggests that their price fluctuations were primarily influenced by conglomerate-level
events, such as the Hindenburg report and bribery charges against the promoters, rather than sector-specific factors.
